# NeuroAssist - AI-Powered Personal Assistant

## Project Plan Overview

This folder contains GitHub-style issues for developing **NeuroAssist**, an AI-powered personal assistant designed specifically for neurodiverse individuals (particularly those with ADHD) who need help capturing chaotic thoughts and organizing them into actionable tasks.

## Project Structure

The development is organized into 3 phases with 18 total issues:

### Phase 1: Basic Task List (Issues #001-#009)
Core functionality including task management, voice input, and cross-device syncing between iPhone and Apple Watch.

### Phase 2: Siri and Intelligence Integration (Issues #010-#014)
Adding voice-driven task management through Siri integration and basic AI categorization.

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Issues #015-#018)
Enhanced features including proactive prioritization, location-based reminders, and calendar integration.

## Technology Stack

- **Platforms**: iOS (iPhone), watchOS (Apple Watch)
- **Development Tools**: Xcode, Cursor (AI-assisted coding)
- **Version Control**: GitHub
- **Frameworks**: SwiftUI, Core Data/UserDefaults, WatchConnectivity, Speech, UserNotifications, Core Location, EventKit

## Issue Format

Each issue follows GitHub conventions:
- **Title**: Clear, actionable description
- **Labels**: Phase, priority, platform, and feature type
- **Description**: Detailed explanation of requirements
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific, testable conditions for completion
- **Implementation Guidance**: Technical hints and Cursor usage tips

## Getting Started

1. Review issues in sequential order starting with #001
2. Each issue is designed to be small and testable
3. Use Cursor for AI-assisted code generation as suggested in the guidance
4. Test thoroughly after each issue completion

## Target User

This app is designed for individuals who:
- Have ADHD or other neurodiverse traits
- Struggle with organizing chaotic thoughts
- Need proactive assistance rather than passive tools
- Benefit from voice-first interfaces
- Require minimal manual structuring

## Key Innovation

Unlike traditional task apps, NeuroAssist focuses on:
- **Effortless capture**: Voice and text input with minimal friction
- **AI-driven organization**: Automatic categorization and prioritization
- **Proactive guidance**: Suggests next steps and provides timely reminders
- **Cross-device integration**: Seamless experience across iPhone and Apple Watch
- **ADHD-friendly design**: Reduces cognitive load and decision fatigue
