# Issue #002: Initialize GitHub repository

**Labels:** `phase-1` `setup` `version-control` `priority-high`

## Description

Create a GitHub repository and connect it to the Xcode project to enable version control, collaboration, and backup of the NeuroAssist codebase.

## Background

Proper version control is essential for tracking development progress, enabling rollbacks if needed, and maintaining a backup of the code. GitHub integration also enables future collaboration and CI/CD workflows.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] GitHub repository is created with appropriate name (e.g., `neuroassist-app`)
- [ ] Repository is initialized with .gitignore file for Xcode projects
- [ ] Local Git repository is connected to GitHub remote
- [ ] Initial commit includes the Xcode project setup from Issue #001
- [ ] README.md file is created with basic project description
- [ ] Repository includes appropriate license file
- [ ] Xcode project can push and pull changes successfully

## Implementation Guidance

### Using Cursor
- Use Cursor to generate appropriate .gitignore content for Xcode/Swift projects
- Ask Cursor to help create a comprehensive README.md
- Use Cursor to verify Git commands if needed

### Technical Steps
1. Create new repository on GitHub (public or private as preferred)
2. Clone repository locally OR initialize Git in existing project folder
3. Add Xcode-specific .gitignore file
4. Create initial README.md with project overview
5. Add and commit all project files
6. Push to GitHub remote

### .gitignore Essentials
```gitignore
# Xcode
build/
*.pbxuser
!default.pbxuser
*.mode1v3
!default.mode1v3
*.mode2v3
!default.mode2v3
*.perspectivev3
!default.perspectivev3
xcuserdata/
*.moved-aside
*.xccheckout
*.xcscmblueprint
DerivedData/
*.ipa
*.dSYM.zip
*.dSYM
```

### README Structure
- Project overview and purpose
- Target audience (ADHD/neurodiverse users)
- Technology stack
- Setup instructions
- Development phases overview

## Definition of Done

- GitHub repository exists and is accessible
- All project files are committed and pushed
- Repository has proper documentation
- Git workflow is established and functional
- Team members can clone and contribute (if applicable)
